  Connect speed : 300 - 56k (if you're lucky)
  Terminal      : ANSI / VT100-ish
  Etiquette     : Don't flood. Don't flame. Be cool.

  What you can do here:
   • Read and post messages (message boards)
   • Upload / download files (file areas)
   • Chat with the sysop (sometimes!)
   • Play door games (Legend of the Red Dragon, etc.)

  Tip: Think of a BBS as a pre-web social network + forum,
       reached by dialing in (later: telnet), one user at a time.
